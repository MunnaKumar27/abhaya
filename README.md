Abhaya - Women Safety Application

Women think twice before stepping out of their house, they live in constant fear. Some of them are even subjected to domestic violence and not well aware of constitutional laws and the organisations which can help them. So our aim is to provide safety as well creating awareness about constitutional rights and various NGOs to them.

How we are trying to solve it?
For women safety we are providing live location sharing through SMS , calling family members and organisations like police, women helpline based on their current location. 
Creating awareness of constitutional laws and bringing justice to all victims through NGOs and contact us section for assisting with their issues.
